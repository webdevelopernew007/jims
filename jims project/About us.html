<h1><b><u>ABOUT US</u></h1>
<p> When writing your About Us page, you don’t want to say the same things that appear on your Home page, and a long, detailed, historical summary will bore the reader. You also don’t want to sound like you’re boasting. As in most things, the best answer is to find the middle ground.

Much like a resume you’d use to land a job, your About Us page is the place to toot your own horn. To avoid bragging or appearing pushy steer clear of hype.  Instead offer a straightforward presentation of the facts and figures.  Avoid superlatives.

For example, explain why people should do business with you. What benefits can you or your product provide that your prospects will value?

If you can, quantify those benefits.  Saying your product increases productivity by 18% is a lot more persuasive than simply saying it improves productivity.

Tell them what problem you solve.  How do you make their life easier and better? Describe your capabilities and why you’re uniquely qualified to offer the service or product you sell.</p>
<p>Before the internet came into existence, most business transactions occurred after a face-to-face meeting. The prospective customer would talk with a sales person or business owner to learn about the company and determine if he felt comfortable doing business with them. Of course, that’s not the case today.
